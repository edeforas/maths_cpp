This is a collection of maths c++ code, mostly in public domain, I also added my algorithms. They should compile without warnings and run under any C++ compiler. CMake files included.

- test_cordic: several Cordic algorithms, direct , alternate, linear, circular, hyperbolic
- test_sqrt: several sqrt algorithms, in float or fixpt, perfect or approximated
- test_pi: several algorithms to compute PI 
- test_butterworth: generate and apply low-pass, band-pass and high-pass filter from relative frequency definition
- test_Mersenne_prime: generate Mersenne primes numbers
- test_syracuse: 3 algorithms to compute cycles or syracuse numbers and search for new possible cycles

Feel free to add your own.
